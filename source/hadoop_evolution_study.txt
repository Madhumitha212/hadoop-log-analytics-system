Hadoop Architecture Evolution Study

Hadoop 1.X Architecture

Overview: 
- Hadoop 1.X follows monolithic architecture.
- Resource management and job scheduling is handled by single master component.

Key Components:
Job Tracker: Handles resource allocation, task monitoring, job scheduling.
Task Tracker: Executes the mapper and reducer on worker nodes.

Limitations:
- Single point of failure
- poor scalability
- Limited resource utilization
- Tight coupling

Hadoop 2.X Architecture

Overview:
Introduction to YARN: YARN(Yet Another Resource Negotiator) separates resource management from job scheduling.

Key Components:
Resource Manager: Manages and allocates cluster-wide resources.
Node Manager: Manages and schedules task on Nodes.
Application Manager: Manages the entire life cycle of application.

Improvements:
- Eliminate single point of failure.
- Responsibilities are distributed which improves scalability.
- Supports multiple frameworks.
- Better resources utilization.

Hadoop 3.X Architecture

Overview:
Hadoop 3.X builds upon YARN and focuses on performance optimization, scalability, and fault tolerance.

Key Enhancements:
- Improved High Availability for ResourceManager and NameNode.
- Better Scalability for large clusters.
- Erasure Coding to reduce storage overhead.
- Enhanced Resource Management and scheduling.

Benefits
- Reduced storage cost
- Higher fault tolerance
- Better cluster performance
